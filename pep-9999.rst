Abstract
========

This PEP introduces the use of the ``as`` keyword to capture the expression serving as condition in ``if`` and ``while`` statements.

The proposed change does not introduce a new kind of expression nor new semantics, but just a way to capture the value of an expression as a _name_ added to the current scope as it is done in the ``with-as`` and ``except-as`` statements.

Specification: The ``if-as`` and ``while-as`` Statements
